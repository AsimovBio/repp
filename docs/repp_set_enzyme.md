## repp set enzyme

Add an enzyme to the enzymes database

### Synopsis


Set an enzyme in the enzymes database so it can be used to linearize backbones.
Enzymes are passed to the build command, by name, with the --enzyme flag.

Valid recognition sequences have both a cut site in the template sequence: "^" and
a cut site in the complement sequence: "_". Use 'repp ls enzyme' for examples

```
repp set enzyme [name] [sequence] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  repp set enzyme BbvCI CC^TCA_GC
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for enzyme
```

### SEE ALSO
