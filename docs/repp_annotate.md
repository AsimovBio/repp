## repp annotate

Annotate a plasmid using features

### Synopsis

Accepts a sequence file as input and runs alignment against the
embedded feature database. Each alignment feature is included as
a feature in the output: a Genbank file. Individual databases
can be selected, in which case the entries in the database will
be used in the alignment _rather_ than the feature database.

The feature database and the default 96% identity are based on
information from [SnapGene](https://www.snapgene.com/resources/plasmid-files/)

  -d, --dbs string       comma separated list of local fragment databases to consider as features
  -u, --dnasu            use the DNASU repository
  -x, --exclude string   keywords for excluding features
  -h, --help             help for annotate
  -p, --identity int     match %-identity threshold (see 'blastn -help') (default 96)
  -g, --igem             use the iGEM repository
  -i, --in string        input file name
  -n, --names            log feature names to the console
  -o, --out string       output file name
```
